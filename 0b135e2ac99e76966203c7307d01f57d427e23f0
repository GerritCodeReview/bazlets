      "message": "I have prefixed the commit message with `tools/eclipse:` to indicate it is only about supporting .classpath generation when using rules_jvm_external. But it was not that clear.\n\nI have rephrased to:\n\n    tools/eclipse: find jar from rules_jvm_external\n\nWhich does not mislead people in thinking the bazlets now magically support rules_jvm_external.  I have made some extra additions to the commit message to explain artifacts are downloaded at a different place than maven_jar.",
