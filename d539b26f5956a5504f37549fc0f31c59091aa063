      "message": "It\u0027s not strictly needed, but someone using gerrit_plugin probably expects it to to honor the kwargs supported by java_binary. We should probably also pass through provided_deps for the same reason. We give both to java_library, but not to java_binary since we don\u0027t pass our kwargs to it.\n\nI can remove this from the series if you have concerns with it.",

      "message": "Let\u0027s not do it, and not on stable branch. I would also prefer that bazlets toolchain is not deverting from gerrit core toolchain. From my perspective, we should add/remove in gerrit core\u0027s features to the toolchain, and replicate those changes in bazlets. Gerrit core version of gerrit_plugin() doesn\u0027t offer runtime_jars, so I wouldn\u0027t expect to be it here as well.",
